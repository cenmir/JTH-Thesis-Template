  Title                    = {Computational Differential Equations},
  Abstract                 = {Introduction This first part has two main purposes. The first is to review some mathematical prerequisites needed for the numerical solution of differential equations, including material from calculus, linear algebra, numerical linear algebra, and approximation of functions by (piecewise) polynomials. The second purpose is to introduce the basic issues in the numerical solution of differential equations by discussing some concrete examples. We start by proving the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus by proving the convergence of a numerical method for computing an integral. We then introduce Galerkin&#039;s method for the numerical solution of differential equations in the context of two basic model problems from population dynamics and stationary heat conduction.},
