\begin{thm}
\cite{Hilbert1893} \label{Hilbert'sTheorem} Some even more profound
result. 
\end{thm}
In Chapter \ref{chapter-on-Gauss} a special case of Theorem \ref{Hilbert'sTheorem}
was proved. We can prove an even more general result.
\begin{thm}
\label{mytheorem} An extremely profound result. \end{thm}
\begin{proof}
As any fool can plainly see, it's true! \end{proof}
